# Synthesis-results
This is the file with all the synthesis results for the 3-PGS two-mode hybrid transmission configuration
The configuration synthesis is divided into two parts: the synthesis of the structure matrix and the synthesis of the position matrix of the auxiliary elements. 
The structure matrix and one of its corresponding position matrices represent a configuration, e.g.:3-2-0-2CL-1B represents the position matrix of a feasible two-mode hybrid transmission (two clutch vapours and a brake) corresponding to the structure matrix 3-2-0; each position matrix in 3-2-0-3CL-1B is combined with 3-2-0 to form a configuration.
